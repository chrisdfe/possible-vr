# Possible VR

## Installation

Run
```
yarn
```

**note**: You'll need to have yarn installed globally to run this. To install yarn:

```
npm install -g yarn
```

## Development

Run these two commands in separate tabs:
1) To start the node server
```
yarn start
```

You should be able to visit [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

2) To start webpack:
```
bin/webpack
```
webpack will watch files in `src/` and recompile when you make changes to them.
